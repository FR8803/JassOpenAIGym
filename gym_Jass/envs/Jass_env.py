  what our actions are doing to the environment, step return four values (implementation of the action-environment loop):
  1. observation (object) -> an environment-specific object representing your observation of the environment. e.g. the board state in a board game.
  2. reward (float) -> reward achieved trough action
  3. done (bool) -> whether environment has to be reseted again (end of an episode, when done == True)
  4. info (dict) -> diagnostic information useful for debugging. It can sometimes be useful for learning (for example, it might contain the raw probabilities behind the environmentâ€™s last state change).
